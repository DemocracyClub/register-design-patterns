    <h2 id="a-register-is-a-promise">A register is a promise</h2>
<p>A register is a list of something important enough that lots of people care about having an <a href="/register-design-patterns/terms/accuracy">accurate</a>, <a href="/register-design-patterns/terms/completeness">complete</a> list of it.</p>
<p>For us to think of a list as a register, some institution or community must have promised to keep it up to date.</p>
<h2 id="registers-are-only-useful-when-we-trust-them">Registers are only useful when we trust them</h2>
<p>This means that we need a reason to trust the process of keeping the list up to date, ideally because the decision making process is clear and transparent.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-registers">Why do we need registers?</h2>
<p>By treating lists as infrastructure we continue to have all of the advantages of maintaining a list that we had previously while also creating additional benefits.</p>
<p>For teams building services that require data, it means that they are only ever working with one reliable and current source of data and can concentrate on building the service rather than checking if the data they’re using is still accurate.</p>
<p>For people who manage data, it means that there is one clear and obvious source of truth - the place in which the register is published.</p>
<p>Infrastructure lists improve the experience of all these people, as well as those who publish and maintain lists, indeed anyone who wants to access them for any reason</p>
<p>Firstly, it creates an environment where we can insist on and enforce certain minimum standards of publication. This in turn allows the creation of tools and ecosystems around these publication standards which make the work of curation, maintenance and consumption easier, faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>Secondly, infrastructure - particularly when operated by the state - implies a commitment. This means that we can operate with the assumption that this accurate list will continue to exist, and that the work of curating it will be undertaken by someone else with that specific responsibility.</p>
<p>Data infrastructure operated by the state functions in much the same way as a universal service - a social or technical system deemed so essential that it should be available regardless of location or ability to pay. We operate with regards to state data infrastructure in the same way we understand that access to water, as well as the administration of water cleaning and filtration, will be ensured by the state, leaving us free to concentrate on other things.</p>
<p>Now that registers can be accessed as machine-readable data online, they are more widely useful than when they were books in council basements. The combination of internet technology for publication and the commitment of the state to maintain them means that society can reap increased benefits from these official lists of things, by consuming and using them in ways that were not previously possible.</p>

              <p>
                This website was created to help people understand registers, lists
                of information and the importance of good governance practices. It
                was the result of a research project into the use of registers…
