By treating lists as infrastructure we continue to have all of the advantages
of maintaining a list that we had previously while also creating additional
benefits.

For teams building services that require data, it means that they are only
ever working with one reliable and current source of data and can concentrate
on building the service rather than checking if the data theyâ€™re using is
still accurate.

For people who manage data, it means that there is one clear and obvious source
of truth - the place in which the register is published.

Infrastructure lists improve the experience of all these people, as well as
those who publish and maintain lists, indeed anyone who wants to access them
for any reason

Firstly, it creates an environment where we can insist on and enforce certain
minimum standards of publication. This in turn allows the creation of tools and
ecosystems around these publication standards which make the work of curation,
maintenance and consumption easier, faster and cheaper.

Secondly, infrastructure - particularly when operated by the state - implies a
commitment. This means that we can operate with the assumption that this accurate
list will continue to exist, and that the work of curating it will be undertaken
by someone else with that specific responsibility.

Data infrastructure operated by the state functions in much the same way as a
universal service - a social or technical system deemed so essential that it
should be available regardless of location or ability to pay. We operate with
regards to state data infrastructure in the same way we understand that access
to water, as well as the administration of water cleaning and filtration, will
be ensured by the state, leaving us free to concentrate on other things.

Now that registers can be accessed as machine-readable data online, they are
more widely useful than when they were books in council basements. The combination
of internet technology for publication and the commitment of the state to maintain
them means that society can reap increased benefits from these official lists of
things, by consuming and using them in ways that were not previously possible.
