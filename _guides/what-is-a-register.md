A register is a list of something important enough that lots of people care about
having an accurate, complete list of it. For us to think of a list as a register,
some institution must have promised to keep it up to date. Registers are only
useful when we trust them. This means that we need a reason to trust the process
of keeping the list up to date, ideally because the decision making process is
clear and transparent.
