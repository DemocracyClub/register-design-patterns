## A register is a promise

A register is a list of something important enough that lots of people care
about having an [accurate][accurate], [complete][complete] list of it.


For us to think of a list as a register, some institution or community must
have promised to keep it up to date.

## Registers are only useful when we trust them

This means that we need a reason to trust the process of keeping the list up
to date, ideally because the decision making process is clear and transparent.
