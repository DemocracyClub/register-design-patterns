Best in class design thinking [starts with needs](https://web.archive.org/web/20140628221103/https://www.gov.uk/design-principles). The hard thing is working out whose needs you need to start with.

For products and services the needs of the end user and any admin users or maintainers are the obvious starting points, however for lists the users should not be confused with the users of the end product that the data is used for.

For example, the [FCO register of countries](https://country.register.gov.uk/) is used on the [register to vote service](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote), but the users of the register are not the people registering to vote.

Thinking about the needs of lists is like thinking about the needs of electricity or a can of blue paint. The users want things like reliability and consistency, and they want those things in turn because they want a cup of tea, or blue walls.
