Governance describes the process of maintaining a register. This includes how
and when information in a register is added, removed or changed and who does
those things. Understanding the governance of a register allows people
considering using the register to make informed decisions about how much they
can rely on it.

We can normally describe the governance of a list by answering a series of
questions about it.

## Who will maintain this register?

When understanding the governance of the register we need to understand which
individual, group or institution is responsible for making sure it remains
accurate and complete.

## How do I add an item to the register?

What is the process for adding an item to the register - what people, tools or
institutions will be involved, will there be an approval step or can I add one
directly?

## How do I correct an error in the register?

Particularly when we are dealing with reality describing registers, we will
find that reality changes and our register becomes inaccurate. When this
happens, we need a way to make changes to that register.

## Who is paying for maintenance of this register?

The practice of ensuring that a register remains accurate and complete over
time requires work. This often requires funding to pay for staff or
infrastructure in order to do this. Understanding who is paying for that - or
if it is being done as a volunteer effort helps us understand the governance of a register.

Understanding who pays for the register is often important because the funder
is likely interested in ensuring the register is maintained for a particular
purpose. Considering these purposes can help us understand how the register is governed.
