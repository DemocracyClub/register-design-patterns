Lists have different relationships to the way in which we understand the world. For instance, the classroom attendance register is describing which children were in the room, while by being on the register of children in class 1B, a child becomes a member of class 1B.

We refer to these types as <strong class="chip">reality describing</strong> or <strong class="chip">reality altering</strong> lists. Some kinds of list cannot be reality altering. For instance, ontologies, reference data, or secondary lists.

## Reality altering
A list that somehow changes reality by an entry appearing. For instance the register of pupils in a class or the register of medical practitioners. This reality altering property is generally associated with the source of authority of the list and will commonly be due to either a logical institutional authority, or legislation that mandates the existence of the list.

## Reality describing
A list that describes the world as observed. For instance a class register of attendance or the wikidata list of countries in the European Union.
