Some lists of things will be the primary source of that information. Others, will not - for instance aggregating several smaller lists or deriving information from another source.

For example the register of a attendance taken by a teacher is the source of data about which children attended, while the school wide attendance register is an aggregated list made up of all the other smaller lists.

We refer to the source lists as <strong class="chip">primary</strong> and the aggregated ones as <strong class="chip">secondary</strong>.


## Primary

A list which is the main source of the information contained within it. For instance a class attendance register, or the register of companies provided by Companies House.

## Secondary

A list which is created from other sources of information. For instance an aggregated register of attendance for ani entire school, or the database of companies provided by Open Corporates.
