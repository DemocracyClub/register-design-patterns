A list may be either complete or incomplete. A list may be incomplete because it does not contain all the entities that should be on the list - for instance a list of pupils in a class which was missing some children. It may also be incomplete because it does not contain all of the pieces of information about each entity.

For instance, a list of contact details which contains a row for each person, but has not yet been filled in with the email and phone number of each person.

The register of pupils is a complete register because it contains all the pupils who are in the class at that time.

Just like the [wikipedia list of deaths in 1989][deaths] doesnâ€™t (at the time of writing) include everyone who died in 1989, the [register of government cats][cats] is incomplete as it contains just some cats that have been reported.
