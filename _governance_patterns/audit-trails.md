## Strengths

Users can see what changes have happened to the list. If a user has an outdated version of the list then, depending on the implementation, they can compare changes.

## Weaknesses

Mistakes show up in logs with a possible cause of confusion. Depending on the governance type, vandalism can be persisted and presented alongside the unvandalised list.

## Discussion

Knowing how a list has changed over time is useful for users trying to see what changes might have been made recently, but also to convey that the list is 'active' and maintained.
