## Discussion


Particularly with reality describing lists, third parties can change a
list that they have no governance over. For example, candidates can withdraw
their nomination for election after the list of candidates for that election
has been published. The International Astronomical Union can change the
definition of a planet. This happened when it caused the removal of Pluto from
the list of planets.

## Examples

* Split your house into flats to edit the list of addresses in the UK
* A candidates can withdraw their nomination for election after the list of candidates for that election has been published.
* The International Astronomical Union can change the definition of a planet, causing the removal of Pluto from the list of planets.
* A court case or other events can cause the removal of a doctor from the GMC register.
* To take an extreme example, it's possible for someone who has no involvement in the governance of the UK country register to change it by invading one of the countries and renaming it.
