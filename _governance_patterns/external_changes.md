In some cases 3rd parties can change a register that they have no governance over.

For example, a candidates can withdraw their nomination for election after the register of candidates for that election has been published. The IAU can change the definition of a planet, causing the removal of Pluto from the register of planets. A court case can cause the removal of a doctor from the GMC register.

To take an extreme example, it's possible for someone who has no involvement in the governance of the UK country register to change it by invading one of the countries and renaming it.
