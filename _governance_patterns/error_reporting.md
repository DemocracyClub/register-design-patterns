This is the simplest form of collaboration, where anyone can report and error to a person, organisation or through a process. Error repointing works for all forms of governance.






### Example

<div class="card-panel">
## National Heritage List for England  reporting 'Minor&nbsp;Amendments'

The list of "listed" buildings in the UK maintained by Historic England publishes [guidance on reporting "minor amendments"][minor_amendments]:

> With almost 400,000 entries on the National Heritage List for England (NHLE), many of which are over 20 years old, we realise that there may be a number of minor errors. Here you can find out how to report minor amendments and how we deal with them.

Reporting an error starts a process of investigation, possible updates to the list and feedback to the initial reporter and "any interested parties".
