On occasion, institutions who are paid to maintain a register are also
instructed to generate revenues from the register. There are three typical
models: charging for updates to the register, selling commercial services
related to that data, or charging for access to the data within the register.
These three models have differing levels of risk of conflict between the
public interest - falling in the long tradition of providing access to such
data for free at the point of use - and institutional revenue maximisation.
