## Strengths

* Clear lines of responsibility

## Weaknesses

While errors can be fixed by the right person within the
organisation that created the list, finding that person is often hard and
formal error reporting mechanisms may not exist. This model is poorly suited
to reality describing registers and only works for reality altering registers
when the custodian is always involved in the change process.

## Discussion

For some registers there is an obvious decision maker who operates upon the
contents of the register by fiat. This is most commonly due to having either
legislative custodianship or institutional authority.

For instance, when Google decide to no longer support the Mosaic web browser
and remove it from their list of supported web browsers, this decision is
taken by a person or group who have been given executive power over it. This
will result in Mosaic being removed from the list of supported web browsers.

If one happens not to be the custodian the ability to affect change in the
register is dramatically reduced. In some cases there may be a clear mechanism
to provide feedback which provides some opportunity to request additions or
corrections, but this is not always the case. Registers which operate a
custodial discretion model may just as easily operate on a whim, or make
decisions in a smoke filled room with minimal transparency over the precise
process.
