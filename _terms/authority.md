When we talk about lists which are complete and accurate (or even lists which are complete and accurate enough to use) we also talk about how we are able to make that assertion. There are various sources of that authority:

## From first principles

Some lists are provably complete and accurate. For example a list of the first thousand prime numbers, could be proved to be complete by calculating those numbers and then looking to see if the register matched the list you had computed.

## Verifiable observation
When the list contains things that have been observed in the world, it would be possible for someone else to recreate the list from scratch by conducting the same observations.
For example, the
[Wikipedia list of rivers longer than 1000km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_by_length#List_of_rivers_longer_than_1000_km)
could be verified by measuring the lengths of rivers.

## Trusted observation

For some lists created by observing the world, re-observation, or verification is not possible. This is often because they take a snapshot of a point in time.
For instance, while a school class attendance register can be validated at the time by a third party, a week later, it is impossible to verify that it is correct.

The authority of such lists depends on the amount of trust we have in whoever made the observation, and in the integrity of the processes for subsequently storing, retrieving and publishing the list.
Demonstrating high quality custodianship practices around the list increases this trust.

## Institutional authority

The contents of the list are logically the responsibility of a single institution, and that institution is asserting that this list is complete and accurate. For instance, when Microsoft publishes a list of software that it provides support for, we believe this list to be complete because Microsoft is in a position to unilaterally decide the contents of the list and so can be trusted if they say this is a complete list.

## Legislative custodianship

The institution responsible for maintaining the list is doing so based on a statutory obligation. For instance, the register of UK political parties is maintained by the Electoral Commission due to their obligations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (amongst others).

## Trust relationship

Often, where a list is not authoritative for one of these reasons, the authority it has is highly subjective, and based upon how much one trusts the organisation who have put together the list to have done a good job.
Demonstrating high quality custodianship practices around the list increases this trust.

In this circumstance, it is hard to have a truly authoritative list. For instance, when looking for a list of companies to use, some people might trust
[Open Corporates](http://opencorporates.com/), while other people might choose to trust
[Thomson Reuters](https://financial.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/data-analytics/company-data.html) or
[Dun and Bradstreet](https://www.dnb.co.uk/about-us/our-data.html).
