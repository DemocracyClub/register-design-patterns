## Strengths

The list can be at least partly funded by updates. Vandalism is less likely than a [direct access][direct_access] model. Fraudulent entries are easier to manage as there is a high chance of having a contact point for the source of the update.


## Weaknesses

Edits and error reporting is less likely. It might be harder to be open about errors if the product makes claims about accuracy.

## Discussion

On occasion, institutions who are paid to maintain a list are also
instructed to generate revenues from the list. There are three typical
models: charging for updates to the list, selling commercial services
related to that data, or charging for access to the data within the list.
These three models have differing levels of risk of conflict between the
public interest - falling in the long tradition of providing access to such
data for free at the point of use - and institutional revenue maximisation.
