The most permissive change model is to provide tools that allow anyone to
directly alter the list. These tools may be an online service acting in a
wiki style, or they may be paper forms that one fills in and then sends to the
custodian responsible for compiling or publishing the list itself.

Direct access models must provide some mechanism to deal with vandalism or
fraudulent entries, and frequently include a more proactive mechanism for
reporting inaccuracies. Particularly with official lists which carry some
legal weight there may be penalties for deliberately entering misinformation
into a list.

Where lists using this model have been created in the recent past, they have
tended be created alongside and evolve with tools explicitly designed to
facilitate these governance processes. This frequently includes some sort of
version control system that allows other users (sometimes only with special
permissions) to roll back malicious or accidental changes. The penalty for
vandalism in such cases is often a ban on a particular user.

In such cases, the governance model and the list are so closely linked that
they are almost the same thing.

In practice, many lists operate a mixed governance model. This allows
maintainers to spend their time more effectively by focussing on tasks or areas
which are particularly complex or sensitive while allowing other people to
effectively collaborate on the maintenance of the list.

For example, [Companies House][companieshouse] allows essentially direct
access to many operations, such as creating a new company or recording a share
issue. In these cases a form is submitted, but not checked beyond minimal
validation. However when a company is struck off, it is only possible to
record this if one is in fact the custodian for that piece of information.

Similarly, with crowdsourced lists such as [Wikidata][wikidata], while the
default is direct access to create, alter or remove entries, certain pages are
protected. This changes the default behaviour such that only administrators
can make such changes.
