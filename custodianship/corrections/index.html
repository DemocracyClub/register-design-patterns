      Lists often contain errors, omissions or inaccuracies. This is particularly true of lists
      which are
          <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/relation-to-reality.md %}" clas="term">
              reality describing</a> and thus will often not have
      changed as fast as reality. When this happens, we need a way to make changes to that list.

      When the process for correcting an error is
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/direct_access.md %}" class="term">
          direct access</a>
      custodians can describe this using language such as:
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      Users of
      <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>
       may correct an error in the map directly using the editing features of the platform itself.

    <h3>
      Suggested edits

      When the process for correcting an error is
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/suggested_edits.md %}" class="term">
          suggested edits</a>
      custodians can describe this using language such as:
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      Anyone may suggest a specific alteration to the
      <a href="https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/">England Local Authorities register</a>.
      The source data files for the register are
      <a href="https://github.com/openregister/local-authority-data/">published on the web</a>
      on a platform which allows anyone to suggest a change.
