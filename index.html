      What is a register?
    </h2>
    <p>
      A register is a list that lots of people care about which an institution
      has promised to keep
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/accuracy.md %}" class="term">
        accurate</a> and
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/completeness.md %}" class="term">
        complete</a>, and has a clear enough
      governance that <strong>people trust it enough to reuse it</strong>.

      How do you get people to trust a list?
    </h2>
    <p>
      People trust lists with good custodianship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large part of custodianship is ensuring the
      <a class="term" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/accuracy.md %}">accuracy</a> and
      <a class="term" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _terms/completeness.md %}">completeness</a>
        of your list by following
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/design-considerations/">best practices for publishing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custodianship is also the set of <strong>processes and tools</strong>
      that govern entries in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many lists, <b>improving the transparency</b> that surrounds these processes is the
      simplest and cheapest way to increase trust in their contents.
