      What is a register?
    </h2>
    <p>
      A register is a list that lots of people care about which an institution
      has promised to to keep <a href="TODO" class="term">accurate</a>
      and <a href="TODO" class="term">complete</a>, and has a clear enough
      governance that <strong>people trust it enough to reuse it</strong>.

      How do you get people to trust a list?
    </h2>
    <p>
      People trust lists with good <a class="term" href="#">custodianship</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large part of <a class="term" href="#">custodianship</a> is ensuring the
      <a class="term" href="#">accuracy</a> and
      <a class="term" href="#">completeness</a> of your list by following
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/design-considerations/">best practices for publishing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custodianship is also the set of <b>processes and tools</b> that govern entries in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many lists, <b>improving the transparency</b> that surrounds these processes is the
      simplest and cheapest way to increase trust in their contents.
